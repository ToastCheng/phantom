********************************************************************************
*            Diffuse Reflectance Spectrum(DRS) for Phantom Generator           *

********************************************************************************
UPDATE(2017.09.13):
 -Create a script "run.sh",enable to customize the size and concentration of
sphere that is interested. Automatic run "MCML_Phantom" and "phase_function"
using given parameters.

UPDATE(2017.09.11): 
 -Save data in different file. Using the rule:"simulation_x.txt",x start from 0.

 -"plot.py" plot the DRS and save in "output_figure"


    It contains two programs, "phase_function" and "MCML_Phantom". The DRS will
be generated by "MCML_Phantom", this program needs THREE input file to work
correctly:

        1.phase_function/input_data/input.txt
        2.phase_function/input_data/index.txt
        3.phase_function/phase/phaseOutput_xxxnm.txt (each wave length gots one)

these three file will be generated by "phase_function".

1.
"input.txt" records the absorption coefficient(mua), scattering coefficient(mus)
 of tissue.

2.
"index.txt" records the refractive index of water and that of phantom(bead).

3.
"phaseOutput_xxxnm.txt" records the phase function respect to angles, xxx stands
for the wavelength.

4.
"output_DRS/simulation_X.txt" this file in directory "output_DRS" records the
reflectance respect to the wavelength.

more details about how to modify parameter of phantom(e.g. size, concentration)
is recorded at README.txt in phase_function directory.
